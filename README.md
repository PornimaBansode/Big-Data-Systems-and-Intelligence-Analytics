## Dataset

It has run and walk dataset. The dataset is collected from accelerometer and gyroscopeThe dataset consists of 88588 sensor data samples which is collected from accelerometer and gyroscope in 10seconds interval and 5.4/second frequency. The data comprises columns acceleration_x, acceleration_y, acceleration_z, gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z.

## Studying Dataset

The dataset consists of 88588 sensor data samples which is collected from accelerometer and gyroscope in 10seconds interval and 5.4/second frequency. The data comprises columns acceleration_x, acceleration_y, acceleration_z, gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z.

## Results

From the training results, we analysed that after applying Logistic Regression model with accuracy score of 0.9999 which proves to be the optimum model. The next model is the Random Forest the accuracy score was 0.9514. Also, Na√Øve Bayes Classification model can be considered as a good model with accuracy of 0.8833.
